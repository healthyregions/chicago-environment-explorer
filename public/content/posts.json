        "content": "Instituto del Progreso Latino (IDPL) is a nonprofit community agency that provides vital legal services and application assistance to citizenship applicants throughout Chicago. Their mission goes beyond legal support‚Äîthey contribute to the fullest development of Latine immigrants and their families through education, training, and employment opportunities that foster full participation in American society while preserving cultural identity and dignity.\n\nIn late 2023, the ChiVes team invited organizations from the Pilsen and Little Village areas to participate in co-design workshops aimed at improving our environmental justice application. Two local organizations, Instituto del Progreso Latino and People's Response Network (PRN), answered this call. In 2024, after a series of listening sessions, we launched together a three-session workshop featuring students and faculty from IDPL alongside PRN members.\n\n## **First Workshop: Listening and Identifying Priorities**\n\nDuring our initial session, after a brief presentation of ChiVes, participants gathered around a printed map to engage in meaningful discussions about environmental challenges facing their communities. The workshop created a space for participants to share their firsthand experiences and identify the most pressing environmental justice concerns across Chicago neighborhoods.\n\nThrough these conversations, several key priority areas emerged, including:\n\n*   Extreme urban heat zones and their disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities\n    \n*   Persistent air quality challenges\n    \n*   Inadequate waste management systems and their effects on neighborhood cleanliness\n    \n*   Widespread sewage infrastructure problems\n    \n\nThese discussions of lived experiences provided crucial context and direction for the subsequent workshop sessions, ensuring ChiVes' focus remained aligned with community needs.\n\n## **Second Workshop: Putting the ChiVes Index Builder to Work**\n\nDuring our second workshop, the research team supported participants in exploring Chives new index builder application to investigate previously identified issues. By engaging with the index builder, participants created their own custom maps of the Chicago environment. Their practical engagement provided crucial insights that helped ChiVes‚Äô design team improve the dashboard's functionality and user experience. After interacting with the index builder, IDPL students designed custom artwork for future integration into ChiVes. At the end of the session, participants identified the need to invite community leaders to brainstorm how they could mobilize the potential outcomes of these workshops.\n\n## **Third Workshop: Building an Action Agenda and Looking Ahead**\n\nOur final workshop featured two speakers: Claudia Galeano-Sanchez (Mujeres por Espacios Verdes) and Rolando Favela (Chicago Urban Forestry Advisory Board). They presented native flower planting initiatives and environmental justice community organization strategies‚Äîdirectly addressing needs identified in earlier sessions. At the end of the third workshop, the speakers and PRN members supported students in developing a comprehensive action agenda for mobilizing ChiVes to raise awareness about environmental justice, with particular emphasis on underserved and migrant communities.\n\nThe partnership with Instituto del Progreso Latino and PRN exemplifies the power of community-centered design in environmental justice work. By incorporating the perspectives and ideas of IDPL students and faculty alongside the expertise and experience of People's Response Network, ChiVes has evolved into a more responsive, effective tool for identifying and addressing environmental inequities in Chicago.\n\nIDPL's commitment to supporting Latino/a immigrants and their families aligns perfectly with ChiVes's mission of ensuring environmental justice for all Chicago residents, regardless of their background or location. As we continue to develop and refine the ChiVes application, the insights and feedback provided by Instituto del Progreso Latino and PRN will remain central to our approach.",
