                <p>The original<span translate="no"> ChiVes </span>application built on multiple former projects from Healthy Regions & Policies Lab members, incorporating materials as well as lessons learned. Much of the data currently integrated within<span translate="no"> ChiVes </span>was gathered, calculated, and standardized from 2018-2021,
                when the HEROP Lab was housed at the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago. The current application was refactored in 2022 by <a href="https://dylanhalpern.com/">Dylan Halpern</a>, adopting a new web architecture.
