                <p>ChiVes is a <b>data collaborative</b> and <b>community mapping application</b> that brings data on Chicago's environment together at the
                neighborhood level. It's a partnership of researchers, community organizations, and civic groups. It's been used for teaching
                about the basics of mapping and spatial analysis, as well as learning about air quality patterns in Chicago.</p>
                <p>With ChiVes, we harmonize & standardize environmental data across dozens of sources to make it accessible for full exploration, alongside a growing list of resources on the Chicago Environment, cultivated by a community of curators.</p>
                <p>To cite the latest release of Chives (<i>Earth Day 2023 </i> Launch), use the following:</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The original<span translate="no"> ChiVes </span>application built on multiple former projects from Healthy Regions & Policies Lab members, incorporating materials as well as lessons learned. Much of the data currently integrated within<span translate="no"> ChiVes </span>was gathered, calculated, and standardized from 2018-2021,
                when the HEROP Lab was housed at the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago. The current application was refactored in 2022 by <a href="https://dylanhalpern.com/">Dylan Halpern</a>, adopting a new web architecture.
